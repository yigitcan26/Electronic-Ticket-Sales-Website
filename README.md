Project Description

• The electronic ticket sale website project is a Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL
project. The final product of this project is a website that uses an event and 
transportation database. Through this website, you can buy tickets to those 
events or transportation routes online.

• The website includes tickets for events like cinema, theater, opera, or 
transportation options like bus. With this, the user can choose an event to go 
to and book ticket for both event and transportation to the city where the 
event is being held.

of this project. Administrators can add events, routes, or even venues to the
database from this website.

• The website has a visually aesthetic look and user-friendly interface.
